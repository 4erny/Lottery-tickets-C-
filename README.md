The idea of my program is to create 100 000 tickets which contains 5 unique numbers from 1 to 25, and then compare this tickets whith my main winning ticket, which contain 4 unique numbers from 1 to 25. After that i have to check how many winners i have, and than i have to divide the prise between the winners in next proportion, people who guesed 3 numbers will have a 30% of budjet and people who guesed all 4 numbers will get the rest 70% of budjet.    I used 3 libraries &lt;stdio.h>, &lt;stdlib.h>, and &lt;time.h>, for my program, 5 functions which generate 20 000 tickets with 5 unique numbers each, and than write 'w' them into the text file. Then i created a winning ticket whith 4 unique numbers, to made my numbers unique, i used a comparing method. For functions with 20 000 tickets i used a 2 dimensional arrays, and for 4 unique numbers in winning ticket i used a 1 dimensional array. Than i read my files and used atoi, to convert my lines from char to integer, for next work with information. I decided to use fscanf, when i read from the file, because in my opinion it's much easier than gets. After all work done, i cheked how many similar numbers 3 or 4, to winning ticket, i have in my 100 000 tickets, than i count the amount of winners and after simple calculations i divided the budjet, between the winners.  Here you could find pictures with all steps.
